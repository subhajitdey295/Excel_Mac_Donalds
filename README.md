Key Findings: 
✔ Financial Performance:
  McDonald's achieved 85% of its targeted sales, totaling $2.544 billion. While profits reached $890 million, representing 89% of the target, there's room for improvement in both areas.
  
✔ Customer Satisfaction:
  Customer satisfaction is relatively high for product availability (95%), hygiene (93%), and quality (86%). However, there are significant opportunities to enhance customer experience by 
  addressing issues of speed (54%) and service (53%).

✔ Sales Trends:
  Sales performance varied by month and year. May 2025 emerged as the peak sales month, followed by December 2026. A deeper dive into seasonal factors and promotional activities during 
  these periods could provide valuable insights.
  
✔ Geographic Performance:
  Argentina stands out as the top-performing country in terms of sales. Analyzing factors contributing to Argentina's success, such as consumer preferences, competition, and marketing 
  strategies, could inform expansion plans in other markets. 
  
Recommendations:
➡ Conduct a thorough analysis of factors impacting sales and profit attainment.
➡ Prioritize initiatives to improve speed and service delivery.
➡ Investigate the underlying reasons for peak sales in May 2025 and December 2026.
➡ Replicate successful strategies from Argentina in other high-potential markets.

By addressing these key areas, McDonald's can enhance overall performance, increase customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.
